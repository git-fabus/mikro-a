# LiberTi*k*Z

This LaTeX package aims to adjust the style of Ti*k*Z arrows to better suit the math font Libertinus Math.
The package can be used by including the package file `libertikz.sty` into the root directory of your project and then loading the package into your project via `\usepackage{libertikz}` or `\RequirePackage{libertikz}` (depending on the kind of project).
One should load `tikz` (resp. `tikzcd`) before `libertikz`.
